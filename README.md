# :hospital: Healthcare_Analytics
Healthcare data these days can be crucial to understanding the patterns and trends of diseases and accordingly preventing them. In this project, I have performed an in-depth analysis of healthcare data as well as developed a dashboard to convey the results. I was able to get some really interesting findings from the data and also created a report presenting all the analysis done on the data. By bridging the gap between raw data and actionable insights, this project contributes significantly to our understanding of healthcare dynamics, fostering a data-driven approach toward disease prevention and management.

## :dart: Steps Involved 
1. Created a table and loaded data from Kaggle to Postgresql, and performed data cleaning and optimization in SQL. Also, was able to answer 6 questions with the help of advanced queries in SQL to get insights about the data.
2. Transferred the clean data from SQL to Python, executed statistical analysis, and created advanced visualizations with the help of Seaborn and Matplotlib.
3. Implemented a comprehensive reporting strategy by loading data into Power BI, creating an insightful dashboard with charts and graphs, and summarizing findings in a detailed PowerPoint report.
