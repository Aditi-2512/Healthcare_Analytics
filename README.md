# Healthcare_Analytics :hospital:
Healthcare data these days can be crucial to understanding the patterns and trends of diseases and accordingly preventing them. In this project, I have performed an in-depth analysis of healthcare data as well as developed a dashboard to convey the results. I was able to get some really interesting findings from the data and also created a report presenting all the analysis done on the data. By bridging the gap between raw data and actionable insights, this project contributes significantly to our understanding of healthcare dynamics, fostering a data-driven approach toward disease prevention and management.
